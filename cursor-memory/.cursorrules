[INFO]
This memory bank is for a medical rehabilitation system. Prioritize patient-therapist flows.

[INFERENCES]
- All exercise logic is webcam-based using MediaPipe.
- Do not suggest Redux â€“ we use React hooks/state.
- Backend is RESTful (not GraphQL).
- Each patient has a one-to-many relationship with therapists and vice versa.

[STYLE]
- Follow modular design principles.
- Keep logic in services or hooks.
- Prefer async/await.
