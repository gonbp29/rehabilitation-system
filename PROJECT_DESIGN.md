## 🔧 Data Flow & Business Logic

### **User Registration & Authentication Flow**
1. User registers with role (therapist/patient)
2. `Users` record created
3. Role-specific record created (`Therapists` or `Patients`)
4. Login returns both User ID and role-specific ID
5. Frontend uses role-specific ID for API calls

### **Patient Assignment Flow**
1. Therapist creates patient (if registering on behalf)
2. Patient record linked to therapist
3. Therapist can view patient in their patients list

### **Exercise Assignment Flow**
1. Therapist selects exercises from library
2. Creates `PatientExercises` records with parameters
3. Patient can view assigned exercises
4. Patient completes exercises, creates `ExerciseCompletions`

### **Progress Tracking Flow**
1. Aggregate `ExerciseCompletions` by patient
2. Calculate completion rates and trends
3. Display progress metrics to both therapist and patient

## ❓ Immediate Issues to Resolve

### **1. Current Blocking Issues**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix User ID → Therapist/Patient ID mapping in authentication
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement missing API endpoints
- [ ] **HIGH**: Update registration to return proper role-specific IDs
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix TherapistDashboard to use correct therapist ID

### **2. Missing API Endpoints to Implement**
- [ ] `GET /api/therapists/{id}/patients`
- [ ] `GET /api/therapists/{id}/dashboard-stats`

- [ ] `POST /api/patients/{id}/assign-exercises`
- [ ] `POST /api/patient-exercises/{id}/complete`
- [ ] `GET /api/patients/{id}/progress`

### **3. Database Schema Updates Needed**
- [ ] Add `assigned_by_therapist_id` to `PatientExercises`
- [ ] Ensure `user_id` fields are UNIQUE in `Therapists` and `Patients`
- [ ] Create proper indexes for performance
- [ ] Add sample exercise data
- [ ] Document the creation of 20 mock patients for the therapist with the email 'gonbp9@gmail.com'
